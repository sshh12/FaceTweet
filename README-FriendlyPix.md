# Friendly Pix Web

Friendly Pix Web is a sample app demonstrating how to build a JavaScript/Web app with the Firebase Platform.

Friendly Pix is a place where you can share photos, follow friends, comment on photos...


## Few words on dependencies

Friendly Pix is built using Javascript, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) and jQuery. The Auth flow is built using [Firebase-UI](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web). Javascript dependencies are managed using [bower](http://bower.io/) and Build/Deploy tools dependencies are managed using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Also Friendly Pix is written in ES2015 so for wide browser support we'll transpile the code to ES5 using [BabelJs](http://babeljs.io). Additionally server-side micro-services are built on [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).


## Create and configure your Firebase Project

1. In a console run `npm install` to install all Build/Deploy tools dependencies.
1. Create a Firebase project using the [Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/console).
2. Enable **Google** as a Sign in provider in **Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign in Method** tab.
3. Enable **Facebook** as a Sign in provider in **Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign in Method** tab. You'll need to provide your Facebook app's credentials. If you haven't yet you'll need to have created a Facebook app on [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com)
4. In a console run `firebase use --add` and, when prompted, select the Firebase Project you have just created. This will make sure the Firebase CLI is configured to use your particular project.


## Start a local development server

You can start a local development server by running:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start `firebase serve` and make sure your Javascript files are transpiled automatically to ES5.

> This is currently broken on 
ws. On Windows please run the following commands separately instead: `bower install`, `babel -w public\scripts -s --retain-lines -d public/scripts-es5` and `firebase serve`.

Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

> Note 1: On new projects, the Realtime Database and Cloud Storage come with default Security rules that prevent all read and writes. Deploy the app once first to deploy the Storage and Database security rules on the project.

> Note 2: Cloud Functions cannot yet be ran locally. Deploy the app once first to deploy and enable the Cloud Functions.


## Deploy the app

Before deploying your code you need to build it for production. Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will install all runtime dependencies and transpile the Javascript code to ES5 and install Cloud Functions dependencies.
Then run:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Then this deploys a new version of your code that will be served from `https://<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com`
